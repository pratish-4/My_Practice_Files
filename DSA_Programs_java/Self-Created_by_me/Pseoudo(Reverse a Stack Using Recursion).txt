//Pseudocode to reverse the stack
function reverse()
   A. IF stack is not empty
        //Hold all items in function call stack until we reach the end of the stack
        1. LET i contains top element from stack.
        2. POP the top element from stack.
        3. reverse() 
        // Insert all the items in function call stack one by one from the bottom to top. Each item is inserted at the bottom of the stack
        4. insertAtEnd(i)
    
// The following function inserts an element at the bottom of a stack
function insertAtEnd(i)
    A. IF stack is empty
           1. PUSH i to the top of the stack
    B. ELSE
        /* All items are held in function call stack until we reach end of the stack.
     When the stack becomes empty the item is inserted at the bottom.*/
           1. In varaible j we will store the value which is at the top of stack.
           2. POP the top element from the stack
           3. insertAtEnd(i)
            //Push all the items which are held in function call stack once the item is inserted at the bottom
           4. PUSH j to the top of the stack
